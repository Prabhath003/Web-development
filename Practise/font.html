    <h1>The Night King</h1>

    <p>The Night King is a legendary figure, known by name among, at least, some noble houses in the North.</p>
    <p>The Night King was a First Man who was captured by a tribe of the Children of the Forest. Leaf, who was among the group, pressed a dragonglass dagger into his chest, causing his eyes to turn blue and  turning him into first of the White Walkers. Thousands of years later, Lead tells Bran Stark that her people created the White Walkers to defend themselves when Westeros was invaded by  the First Men, who were cutting their sacred trees down and slaughtering the Children of the Forest.</p>
